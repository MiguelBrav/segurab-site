The software job market isn’t what it was a few years ago. Layoffs, hiring freezes, and AI automation have reshaped how companies hire—and how developers need to position themselves.

At SeguraB, we’ve worked with developers and teams across multiple industries. Whether you're a recent grad, a mid-level dev changing stacks, or a senior looking for more purpose, this post is for you.

## The Job Hunt in 2025: What's Different?

- **AI-generated resumes** and generic applications have flooded recruiters' inboxes  
- **Remote-first roles** are fewer and more competitive  
- **Hiring managers value practical skills over credentials**  
- **Personal branding** has become a real differentiator

So what can *you* do to actually get hired?

## 1. Build More Than a Resume

Your resume is no longer the first impression—**your GitHub, portfolio, and LinkedIn are**. Make sure they show:

- Real, working code  
- Clear project descriptions  
- Contribution to open-source or side projects  
- Tech stacks listed with context (not just buzzwords)

## 2. Apply Strategically, Not Blindly

Don’t send out 200 generic resumes. Instead:

- Target companies that match your values or stack  
- Write personalized cover letters (or at least custom intros)  
- Connect with engineers or managers on LinkedIn first  
- Use referrals and communities—**they still work**

## 3. Learn to Talk About Your Work

Tech interviews are half code, half communication. Be ready to:

- Explain trade-offs you made in your projects  
- Walk through your decision-making process  
- Talk about failures and what you learned  
- Share how you stay updated (courses, blogs, open-source, etc.)

Pro tip: Practice talking out loud while coding. It helps.

## 4. Don’t Ignore "Soft" Skills

Yes, you're a dev—but hiring managers care if you're:

- Easy to work with  
- Clear in your writing  
- Comfortable with async collaboration  
- Open to feedback and mentorship  

Especially in remote or hybrid teams, **soft skills = trust**.

## 5. The AI Angle: Use It Smartly

AI isn’t the enemy—it’s your secret weapon:

- Use ChatGPT or Copilot to practice problems or refactor code  
- Let AI help prep for behavioral questions or mock interviews  
- Use it to brainstorm projects that show off your skills  

But don’t rely on it to do your thinking. You still need to understand the work.

## Final Thoughts

Finding a job in tech today takes more than applying online. You need **intentionality**, **visibility**, and **clarity** about what you bring to the table.

At **SeguraB**, we believe every developer has value—sometimes they just need help **telling their story and showing their skills**.
